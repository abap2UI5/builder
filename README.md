# abap2UI5-builder

Easily create your own abap2UI5 build with the ABAP version and addons you need.

Features:
* Integrates abap2UI5, frontend, and multiple addons into a single project
* Automatically renames all artifacts to your custom namespace
* Supports multiple builds on the same system
* Install your new build with a single abapGit pull

Find default builds for various use cases [here.](https://github.com/abap2UI5/build)

### Build Process
1. Edit the configuration file `build.jsonc` to specify the ABAP version and repositories to include [here:](./setup/build.jsonc)
```json
{
  "abap_version": "Cloud",
  "repositories": [
    "abap2UI5",
    "layout-variant-management",
    "table-maintenance"
  ]
}
```
Then run the clone process:
```sh
npm run clone
```
2. (optional) Customize the namespace in `rename.jsonc` [here](./setup/rename.jsonc), then run:
```sh
npm run rename
```
3. (optional) Configure abaplint in `abaplint.jsonc` [here](./setup/abaplint.jsonc), then run:
```sh
npm run abaplint
```
4. Your new build is located in the dist folder. Create a new build branch with:
```
npm run branch
git checkout -b build
git add .
git commit -m "my new build"
git push origin build --force
```
5. Pull this branch into your ABAP system via abapGit, and youâ€™re ready to go! ðŸŽ‰

###### Automate with GitHub Actions
You can automate the build process using GitHub Actions:
```sh
npm run build
```

###### Namespace
All artifacts are generated under the zabap2ui5 namespace. This allows both development (`z2ui5`) and production (`zabap2ui5`) versions to coexist in the same system. To use a custom namespace, modify the `rename.jsonc` file.

###### Transport to Production
The development version (`z2ui5`) remains in a local package within the development system. The productive version (`zabap2ui5` or a customer namespace) can be transported like any other backend artifact to quality and production systems.

###### Update Cycle
The development version can be updated frequently to develop new features and bug fixes for abap2UI5. The productive version is updated only when necessary, reducing testing efforts, transport overhead, and other update-related tasks.

### Limitations & To-Do
* Frontend renaming with custom namespaces (e.g., /ZZZ/) is not yet supported [[1493]](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5/issues/1493)
